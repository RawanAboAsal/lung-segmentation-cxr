# lung-segmentation-cxr
Automated lung segmentation from chest X-rays using a modular deep learning framework. Combines CNN encoders and Transformer-based attention within a UNet-like structure. Evaluated multiple encoders on the Shenzhen CXR dataset; ResNet34-UNet achieved the best balance of accuracy, loss, and efficiency.
